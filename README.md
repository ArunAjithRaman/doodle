# doodle

This repository is created for giving Demo on Git & Git Hub.

Things I did for making this repository.

+ Created a empty repository name `doodle` in [GitHub] (https://pages.github.com/new).
+ Copied the contents from the pages titled `create a new repository on the command line` and the lines are
```
echo "# doodle" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/ArunAjithRaman/doodle.git
git push -u origin main
```
